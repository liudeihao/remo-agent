description: >-
  Default remo-agent workflow (user need not ask): prepare motion-view components before
  Remotion composition and plan wiring. Reuse only when semantics fully match; otherwise implement
  dedicated views. Forbids hacking existing components and force-fitting the wrong primitive.
  Triggers: new kind, missing SlideView, video-plan or render work that implies new visuals,
  组件先行, before Remotion, 不要凑合, 不要魔改. Pairs with remo-agent-motion-views; precedes
  remo-agent-video-plan / remo-agent-remotion-render. Counters over-reuse and “JSON-only new look.”

# remo-agent — Component readiness (before Remotion)

## Intent

Ship **honest** motion-view code: the right building blocks exist **before** heavy `VideoFromPlan` / timeline work. **Libraries** for domains (parsing, auth, math) still follow `.cursor/rules/prefer-existing-solutions.mdc`; this skill governs **project-owned `*SlideView` code and primitives**, not npm shopping.

**Project default:** `.cursor/rules/component-first-default.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/motion-explainer-product.mdc` (`alwaysApply: true`) bind order and product shape—you do **not** need the user to say “组件先行” each time. Read this skill when the task touches new or changed on-screen visuals.

## When to use

- **Always** for a new `kind`, new/changed `SlideView`, or any task that would otherwise lean on plan JSON / Remotion first while views are missing or a poor semantic fit.
- User explicitly narrows scope (e.g. “only fix JSON”)—then follow their scope, but do not use that as an excuse to force-fit components.

## Workflow (order matters)

1. **Inventory** — List shots: layout role, data shown, motion contract, and which `kind` / `SlideView` each needs.
2. **Gap analysis** — For each shot, decide: **existing view fits completely** vs **missing or wrong semantics** (see `remo-agent-motion-views`: reuse only when meaning matches).
3. **Implement gaps** — Add **new** `*SlideView`, primitives, or registry entries. Extract shared **small** helpers if two honest views share mechanics; do **not** widen one view with “modes” to mean something else.
4. **Wire types & catalog** — `videoPlan.ts`, `slideRegistry`, `SLIDE_CATALOG`, [slide-kinds.md](../remo-agent-video-plan/references/slide-kinds.md) as required by the motion-views skill.
5. **Only then** — Author or adjust `VideoPlan` (`remo-agent-video-plan`) and Remotion entry/render (`remo-agent-remotion-render`).

## Hard rules

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **No force-fit** | If the closest component is “almost” right but teaches the **wrong relationship** or layout role, **do not** use it. Add the correct component. |
| **No hack / 魔改** | Do not bolt one-off behavior onto unrelated shared views, explode props, or branch on video-specific hacks inside generic components. Prefer a **new** named view or a **small** shared primitive used by both. |
| **Reuse bar** | Reuse is allowed only when **semantics and motion contract** already match (same as motion-views **semantics before reuse**). “Saves typing” is never sufficient. |

## Anti-lazy reuse (models over-default to “use what exists”)

- **New effect / new hero look** → default path is **new or extended presentation code** (primitive, `SlideView`, or honest new `kind`), not “tune JSON under the nearest old kind.”
- If you choose reuse, **say one sentence why** both meaning and motion already match. If you cannot, **build instead**.

## Quality gate (before Remotion-heavy work)

- Every planned `kind` has a **dedicated** or **correctly shared** implementation path; no TODO left as “we’ll fake it in JSON.”
- No new `mode` / `variant` whose **name** hides a different **meaning** (that should be a different component or kind).
